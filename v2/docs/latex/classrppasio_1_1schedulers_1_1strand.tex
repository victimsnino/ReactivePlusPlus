\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Asio based scheduler where each worker is assigned an asio {\ttfamily strand} to execute schedulables with the guarantee that none of those {\ttfamily schedulables} will execute concurrently. 

This scheduler can efficiently enable multi-\/threading execution when running provided io\+\_\+context in multiple threads. Compared to the {\ttfamily thread\+\_\+pool} scheduler, a worker is not pinned to a single thread and {\ttfamily schedulables} are instead dynamically dispatched to potentially different io\+\_\+context threads depending on load. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
