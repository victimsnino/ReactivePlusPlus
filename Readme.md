## What is that?

ReactivePlusPlus is reactive programming library for C++20 language inspired by "official implementation" ([RxCpp](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp)) and original idea ([ReactiveX](https://reactivex.io/)) that only depends on standard library and C++20 features (mostly on [concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints)).


### But... what is that?

To put it even simpler: ReactivePlusPlus is library for building asynchronous event-driven streams of data with help of sequences of primitive operators in the declarative form. Like this:

```cpp
rpp::source::from_callable(&::getchar)
   | rpp::operators::repeat()
   | rpp::operators::take_while([](char v) { return v != '0'; })
   | rpp::operators::filter(std::not_fn(&::isdigit))
   | rpp::operators::map(&::toupper)
   | rpp::operators::subscribe([](char v) { std::cout << v; });
```

<details><summary>Explanation</summary>
There we are creating observable (soure of emissions/values/data) to emit value via invoking of `getchar` function, `repeat`-ing it infinite amount of time till termination event happening. It emits values while symbol is not equal to `0`, taking only **not** digits, maping them to upper case and then just printing to console.
</details>


Also RPP supports QT out of box. Checkout [RPPQT reference](https://victimsnino.github.io/ReactivePlusPlus/v2/docs/html/group__rppqt.html). For example:
```cpp
auto button = new QPushButton("Click me!");
auto label  = new QLabel();
rppqt::source::from_signal(*button, &QPushButton::clicked); // <------ react on signals
   | rpp::operators::observe_on(rpp::schedulers::new_thread{})
   // some heavy job
   // .....
   | rpp::operators::scan(0, [](int seed, auto) { return ++seed; })
   | rpp::operators::observe_on(rppqt::schedulers::main_thread_scheduler{}) // <--- go back to main QT scheduler
   | rpp::operators::subscribe([&clicks_count_label](int clicks)
   {
      clicks_count_label->setText(QString{"Clicked %1 times in total!"}.arg(clicks));
   });
```

## What about existing Reactive Extension libraries for C++?

Reactive programming is a powerful paradigm for creating multi-threaded and real-time applications. Unfortunately, at the moment of creating ReactivePlusPlus, there is only one stable and fully-implemented library available - [RxCpp](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp).

While RxCpp is a great and powerful library, it has some disadvantages. It is written in C++11 and contains parts written in pre-C++11 style. This leads to a mess of old-style classes and wrappers. Additionally, the `rxcpp::observable` type has a long chain of template parameters, which can lead to slower IDE performance and larger binaries. Sometimes it has bad perfomance due to tremendous amount of usage of heap or just non-effective logic.

Another implementation is [another-rxcpp](https://github.com/CODIANZ/another-rxcpp) which uses type erasure and `std::function`, but itt casues larger observer/observable size and potentially casues performance issues.

### Why ReactivePlusPlus?

**ReactivePlusPlus** tries to solve all mentioned issues:
- **ReactivePlusPlus** written in **Modern C++ (C++20)** with concepts which makes code-base a lot more understandable and clean:
   - Concepts provide more clear errors and checks: you will understand that pass something incorrect before compilation in IDE or during compilation with understandable errors instead of _"invalid template class map_invalid_t"_
   - Everywhere while possible used deduction of template arguments, for example, type of values of observable by type of subscriber used in on_subscribe and etc
- **ReactivePlusPlus** keeps balance between performance and type-erasing mechanism
- **ReactivePlusPlus** is fast: every part of code written with perfomance in mind. Starting from tests over amount of copies/move and finishing to Continous Benchmarking. Benchmarks prove that RPP faster than RxCPP in most cases: [Continous benchmarking results and comparison with RxCpp](https://victimsnino.github.io/ReactivePlusPlus/v2/benchmark)

Currently ReactivePlusPlus is still under development but it has a lot of implemented operators for now. List of implemented features can be found in [API Reference](https://victimsnino.github.io/ReactivePlusPlus/v2/docs/html/group__rpp.html) with very detailed documentation for each of them.

Main advantages of ReactivePlusPlus are that it is written in Modern C++ with Performance and Usage in mind. v2 written to follow [**"zero-overhead principle"**](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/Zero-overhead_principle) As a result it is fast, readable, easy to use and well-documented. And it is proven with [continous benchmarking results of v2 and comparison with RxCpp](https://victimsnino.github.io/ReactivePlusPlus/v2/benchmark)

## Usage

See the [BUILDING](BUILDING.md) document to know how to build/install RPP.
If you are going to know more details about developing for RPP check [HACKING](HACKING.md) document.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> ReactivePlusPlus is library for C++20. So, it works only on compilers that supports most C++20 features. List of minimal supported compilers:
> - (ubuntu) gcc-10
> - (ubuntu) clang-11
> - (windows) visual studio 2022
> - (macos) Apple Clang 14
