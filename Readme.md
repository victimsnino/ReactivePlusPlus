## Usage:

ReactivePlusPlus is reactive programming library for C++ language inspired by "official implementation" ([RxCpp](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp)) and original idea ([ReactiveX](https://reactivex.io/)) that only depends on standard library and C++20 features.

See the [BUILDING](BUILDING.md) document to know how to build RPP.
If you are going to know more details about developing for RPP check [HACKING](HACKING.md) document.

## Implementation status:

In short: ReactivePlusPlus is library for building asynchronous event-driven streams of data with help of sequences of primitive operators in the declarative form.

Currently ReactivePlusPlus is still under development but it has a lot of implemented operators for now. List of implemented features can be found in [API Reference](https://victimsnino.github.io/ReactivePlusPlus/docs/html/group__rpp.html) with very detailed documentation for each of them

**Example**:

```cpp
rpp::source::from_callable(&::getchar)
   .repeat()
   .take_while([](char v) { return v != '0'; })
   .filter(std::not_fn(&::isdigit))
   .map(&::toupper)
   .subscribe([](char v) { std::cout << v; });
```

### QT Support

On a par with this ReactivePlusPlus provides native support for QT via RppQt target (extension over original RPP). List of implemented features can be found in [QT API Reference](https://victimsnino.github.io/ReactivePlusPlus/docs/html/group__rppqt.html) with very detailed documentation for each of them.

Currently it provides ability to create observable from QT signal of some QObject and scheduler to schedule emissions to "main" thread.

**Example**:
```cpp
QLabel      label{};
QPushButton button{"CLick me"};

auto amount_of_clicks = rppqt::source::from_signal(button, &QPushButton::pressed)
                          .scan(size_t{}, [](size_t seed, const auto&) { return seed + 1; })
                          .start_with(size_t{})
                          .publish()
                          .ref_count();

amount_of_clicks
  .observe_on(rpp::schedulers::new_thread{})
  .tap([](const auto&)
      {
          std::cout << "Some long computation...." << std::endl;
          std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds{1});
      })
  .observe_on(rppqt::schedulers::main_thread_scheduler{})
  .combine_latest([](size_t slow_clicks, size_t fast_clicks)
                  {
                      return QString{"Slow clicks are %1. Fast clicks are %2"}.arg(slow_clicks).arg(fast_clicks);
                  },
                  amount_of_clicks)
  .subscribe([&](const QString& text) { label.setText(text); });
```

## Features:

Main advantages of ReactivePlusPlus are that it is written in Modern C++ with Performance and Usage in mind. As a result it is fast, readable, easy to use and well-documented. And it is proven with [continous benchmarking results and comparison with RxCpp](https://victimsnino.github.io/ReactivePlusPlus/benchmark)

**NOTE**: ReactivePlusPlus is library for C++20. So, it works only on compilers that supports most C++20 features. List of minimal supported compilers:
- (ubuntu) gcc-10
- (ubuntu) clang-11
- (windows) visual studio 2022
- (macos) Apple Clang 13
