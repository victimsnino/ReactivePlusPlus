## Usage:

ReactivePlusPlus is reactive programming library for C++ language inspired by "official implementation" ([RxCpp](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp)) and original idea ([ReactiveX](https://reactivex.io/)) that only depends on standard library and C++20 features.

See the [BUILDING](BUILDING.md) document to know how to build RPP.
If you are going to know more details about developing for RPP check [HACKING](HACKING.md) document.

## Example:

In short: ReactivePlusPlus is library for building asynchronous event-driven streams of data with help of sequences of primitive operators in the declarative form. For example:

```cpp
rpp::source::from_callable(&::getchar)
   .repeat()
   .take_while([](char v) { return v != '0'; })
   .filter(std::not_fn(&::isdigit))
   .map(&::toupper)
   .subscribe([](char v) { std::cout << v; });
```
## Features:

Main advantages of ReactivePlusPlus are that it is written in Modern C++ with Performance and Usage in mind. As a result it is fast, readable, easy to use and well-documented. And it is proven with [continous benchmarking results and comparison with RxCpp](https://victimsnino.github.io/ReactivePlusPlus/benchmark)

**NOTE**: ReactivePlusPlus is library for C++20. So, it works only on compilers that supports most C++20 features. CI uses gcc-10, clang-11, visual studio 2022

## Implementation status:

Currently ReactivePlusPlus is still under development but it has a lot of implemented operators for now. List of implemented features can be found in [API Reference](https://victimsnino.github.io/ReactivePlusPlus/docs/html/group__rpp.html) with very detailed documentation for each of them

On a par with this ReactivePlusPlus provides native support for QT via RppQt target (extension over original RPP). List of implemented features can be found in [QT API Reference](https://victimsnino.github.io/ReactivePlusPlus/docs/html/group__rppqt.html) with very detailed documentation for each of them.
