Reactive\+Plus\+Plus is reactive programming library for C++ language inspired by \char`\"{}official implementation\char`\"{} (\href{https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp}{\texttt{ Rx\+Cpp}}) and original idea (\href{https://reactivex.io/}{\texttt{ ReactiveX}})

In short\+: Reactive\+Plus\+Plus is library for building asynchronous event-\/driven streams of data with help of sequences of primitive operators in the declarative form. For example\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{rpp::source::create<char>([](\textcolor{keyword}{const} \textcolor{keyword}{auto}\& sub)}
\DoxyCodeLine{   \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{     \textcolor{keywordflow}{while} (sub.is\_subscribed())}
\DoxyCodeLine{         sub.on\_next(std::getchar());}
\DoxyCodeLine{   \})}
\DoxyCodeLine{   .take\_while([](\textcolor{keywordtype}{char} v) \{ \textcolor{keywordflow}{return} v != \textcolor{charliteral}{'0'}; \})}
\DoxyCodeLine{   .filter(std::not\_fn(\&::isdigit))}
\DoxyCodeLine{   .map(\&::toupper)}
\DoxyCodeLine{   .subscribe([](\textcolor{keywordtype}{char} v) \{ std::cout << v; \});}

\end{DoxyCode}


Main advantages of Reactive\+Plus\+Plus are that it is written in Modern C++ with Performance and Usage in mind. As a result it is fast, readable, easy to use and well-\/documented.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{What about existing Reactive Extension libraries for C++?}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
Reactive programming is excelent programming paradigm and approach for creation of multi-\/threading and real-\/time programs which reacts on some events. Unfortunately, there is only one stable and fully-\/implemented library at the moment of creation of Reactive\+Plus\+Plus -\/ \href{https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp}{\texttt{ Rx\+Cpp}}.

\href{https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp}{\texttt{ Rx\+Cpp}} is great and awesome library and perfect implementation of ReactiveX approach. However Rx\+Cpp has some disadvantages\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It is a bit $\ast$$\ast$\char`\"{}old\char`\"{} library written in C++11$\ast$$\ast$ with some parts written in the {\bfseries{pre-\/\+C++11 style}} (mess of old-\/style classes and wrappers)
\item {\bfseries{Issue}} with {\bfseries{template parameters}}\+: {\ttfamily rxcpp\+::observable} contains {\bfseries{full chain of operators}} as second template parameter... where each operator has a bunch of another template parameters itself. It forces {\bfseries{IDEs}} works {\bfseries{slower}} while parsing resulting type of observable. Also it forces to generate {\bfseries{heavier binaries and debug symbols and slower build time}}.
\item It has high perfomance cost due to tremendous amount of usage of heap
\end{DoxyItemize}

Another implementation of RX for c++\+: \href{https://github.com/CODIANZ/another-rxcpp}{\texttt{ another-\/rxcpp}}. It partly solves issues of Rx\+Cpp via {\bfseries{eliminating of template parameter}} with help of {\bfseries{type-\/erasing}} and making each callback as {\ttfamily std\+::function}. As a result issue with templates resvoled, but this approach has disadvantages related to runtime\+: resulting size of observers/observables becomes greater due to heavy {\ttfamily std\+::function} object, usage of heap for storing everything causes perfomance issues, implementation is just pretty simple and provides a lot of copies of passed objects.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Why Reactive\+Plus\+Plus?}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
{\bfseries{Reactive\+Plus\+Plus}} tries to solve all mentioned issues\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Reactive\+Plus\+Plus}} written in {\bfseries{Modern C++ (C++20)}} with concepts which makes code-\/base a lot more understandable and clean\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Concepts provide more clear errors and checks\+: you will understand that pass something incorrect before compilation in IDE or during compilation with understandable errors instead of \+\_\+\char`\"{}invalid template class map\+\_\+invalid\+\_\+t\char`\"{}\+\_\+
\item Everywhere while possible used deduction of template arguments, for example, type of values of observable by type of subscriber used in on\+\_\+subscribe and etc
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Reactive\+Plus\+Plus}} keeps balance between performance and type-\/erasing mechanism\+: Read about it in ./docs/\+Specific\%20vs\%20\+Dynamic.\+md \char`\"{}$\ast$$\ast$\char`\"{}Performance vs Flexibility\+: Specific vs Dynamic\char`\"{}$\ast$$\ast$\char`\"{}
\item {\bfseries{Reactive\+Plus\+Plus}} is fast\+: every part of code written with perfomance in mind. Starting from tests over amount of copies/move and finishing to Continous Benchmarking. Benchmarks show that RPP faster that Rx\+CPP in most cases\+: \href{https://victimsnino.github.io/ReactivePlusPlus/benchmark}{\texttt{ Continous benchmarking results}}

Reactive\+Plus\+Plus library uses\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2}{\texttt{ Catch2}} for unit testing only, you can avoid cloning it if you don\textquotesingle{}t need unit-\/tests
\item \href{https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp}{\texttt{ Rx\+Cpp}} only for comparison of performance between RPP and Rx\+Cpp in CI benchmarks. Used as cmake dependency under option
\item \href{https://reactivex.io}{\texttt{ reactivex.\+io}} as source for insipration and definition of entities used in RPP. Some comments used in RPP source code taken from \href{https://reactivex.io}{\texttt{ reactivex.\+io}}
