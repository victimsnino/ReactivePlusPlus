# Building with CMake

## Build

This project doesn't require any special command-line flags to build to keep
things simple.

Here are the steps for building in release mode with a single-configuration
generator, like the Unix Makefiles one:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

Here are the steps for building in release mode with a multi-configuration
generator, like the Visual Studio ones:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

But RPP is header-only library, so, without enabling any extra options is just compiles "nothing". So, you can use next options to enable/disable some parts of project:

- `RPP_BUILD_TESTS` - (ON/OFF) build unit tests (default OFF)
- `RPP_BUILD_EXAMPLES` - (ON/OFF) build examples of usage of RPP (default OFF)
- `RPP_BUILD_SFML_CODE` - (ON/OFF) build RPP code related to SFML or not (default OFF) - requires SFML to be installed
- `RPP_BUILD_QT_CODE` - (ON/OFF) build RPPQT related code (examples/tests)(rppqt module doesn't requires this one) (default OFF) - requires QT5/6 to be installed

By default, it provides rpp and rppqt INTERFACE modules.

<!-- ### Building on Apple Silicon

CMake supports building on Apple Silicon properly since 3.20.1. Make sure you
have the [latest version][1] installed. -->

## Install

This project doesn't require any special command-line flags to install to keep
things simple. As a prerequisite, the project has to be built with the above
commands already.

The below commands require at least CMake 3.15 to run, because that is the
version in which [Install a Project][2] was added.

Here is the command for installing the release mode artifacts with a
single-configuration generator, like the Unix Makefiles one:

```sh
cmake --install build
```

Here is the command for installing the release mode artifacts with a
multi-configuration generator, like the Visual Studio ones:

```sh
cmake --install build --config Release
```

Optionally you can download it via FetchContent

```cmake
Include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
    RPP
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/victimsnino/ReactivePlusPlus.git
    GIT_TAG        origin/v2
)

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(RPP)
```

### CMake package

This project exports a CMake package to be used with the [`find_package`][3]
command of CMake:

* Package name: `RPP`
* Target names:
 - `RPP::rpp` - main rpp INTERFACE target
 - `RPP::rppqt` - additional INTERFACE target to extend functionality for QT. rppqt doesn't include QT or even doesn't link with that.

Example usage:

```cmake
find_package(RPP REQUIRED)
# Declare the imported target as a build requirement using PRIVATE, where
# project_target is a target created in the consuming project
target_link_libraries(
    project_target PRIVATE
    RPP::rpp
    RPP::rppqt
)
```

## Usage:

To use ReactivePlusPlus in your code just do
```cpp
#include <rpp/rpp.hpp>
```
to include whole library functionality and don't worry about includes. Also you can include only forwardings for everyting
```cpp
#include <rpp/fwd.hpp>
```
To avoid including "everyting" you can just include some iterested part of code (or forward it as well)
```cpp
#include <rpp/operators/map.hpp>
#include <rpp/observables/fwd.hpp>
```
**NOTE**: In case of partial including of operators you need to include headers for each used operators like
```cpp
#include <rpp/operators/map.hpp>
#include <rpp/operators/filter.hpp>

```
else it would not be possible to compile
